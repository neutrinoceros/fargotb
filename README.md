# Fargo ToolBox

*This software suite is developped by* [Clément Robert](mailto:clement.robert@protonmail.com) *for* [FARGO](http://fargo.in2p3.fr/)*, a project started by Frédéric Masset.*



## Content

### longRunGenerator v1.0
longRunGenerator creates more job files and launch them on the go in an append-chain. It gathers information provided in an input file formatted as longRun_input_example.par


### duplicate v1.1
```
duplicate base target
```
copies the file tree of _$base_ into a new directory _$target_. It excludes content from _$base_/output/ and OAR output files.
It also automatically edit all files newly copied to replace every occurence of _$base_ by _$target_ so the new simulation could in principle be ran immediatly.
Nonetheless, a security has been added to prevent over-enthousiastic users from deleting their results in _$base_ in case something went wrong during the copy or the editing : the original executable files are deprieved of their "x" permission so it has to be turned back on manually using chmod before liftoff.


### slaughter v1.2

examples :
```
slaughter
```
kills every jobs that match the $USER name, after confirmation

```
slaughter -p label
```
kills every jobs that match the $USER name and the given label. **-p** has aliases (**-P**|**--picky).

## Python (plotting tools) content

### parse2dto1d
This program turns 2d output files generated by fargo into 1d integrated (and azimuthally averaged) profiles that are better suited for plotting, analysis and scp'ing.


## Installation

> Installation file currently is not working, this issue will be adressed before first release

recommanded method : 
copy the source in the directory of your choice
```
